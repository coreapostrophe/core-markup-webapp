# Basic Ways of Representing Information

## Basic Ways of Representing Information

*Analog and Digital
- distinguished by the nature of the values that they allow information variables to asssume

*Analog Quantities
- Information that can vary over a continuous range of values.

*Digital Quantities
- Information that is represented by a fixed number of discrete symbols called digits.

$Advantages of Digital Techniques
- Digital system design is easier
- Information storage is easy
- Greater precision and accuracy
- Programmability
- Less susceptible to noise
- Digital circuitry can be fabricated on IC chips

$ Base-r to Decimal
-$ 1. Multiply each coefficient with the corresponding power of r
-- 1.1. For the integer part, power of r goes from 0 to n-1 where n is the number of digits in the integer part
-- 1.2. For the fractional part, power of r goes from -1 to -m where m is the number of digits in the fractional part
- 2. Get the sum
